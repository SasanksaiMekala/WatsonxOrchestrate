WatsonXOrchestrate Challenge 

Watson orchestrate is an unique platform where we have created an entire process within no time with the inbuilt capabilities it has.
First we have created the skill which acts as piece of work in the entire process. These skills are the reusable components which can be leveraged across the processes.
We have created two types of skills which is of normal and composite. The normal skills are created by uploading the json file and then configuring the properties like Skill enhancement, Next best skill e.t.c... Composite skill is a combination of skill which can be designed into flow which acts as a crucial point to build the logics for the entire process.
We then configured the custom skill which are available predefined from Watson orchestrate like Gmail skill to send out emails which make our lifes easier.
